    "In this session, we will cover routine troubleshooting in patient-specific verifications. As this Quality Check (QC) is used as a key step in the treatment planning work-flow it is important to understand the test and what the results signify to us. Below is an example of the treatment planning work-flow and where the patient-specific verification is located. As you can see it takes place towards the end and helps us **ensure that the treatment plan we would want to deliver can *actually* be delivered on the treatment machine.** "

The criteria for the gamma analysis can vary depending on the treatment centre and the site which is being treated.

However, when used within the clinic most Gamma Analysis will be performed for either 2D or 3D dose distributions. Luckily the methodology remains mostly the same in both 2D and 3D analysis. The process above remains constant, we just need to test more points within the distance-to-agreement metric we use for each dimension. This is primarily what makes the computation time start to ramp up as the number of pixels you need to check is cubed with each added dimension.
